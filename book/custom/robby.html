* Genuinely interested in why the academic definition is this way. I'm not academic and the first common definitions the OP laid out seem much more useful and linguistically consistent than the academic version of 'Anyone who believes there is no God'. That definition only describes a small subset of non believers.

To highlight what I mean I'll reiterate the common usage which uses the usual meaning of the prefix 'a' meaning 'without'. (As in moral/amoral)

Theism = Belief in God A-theism = Without belief in God

Gnosticism = Knowledge of God A-gnotsic = Without knowledge of God

Thus pretty much all positions can be accurately described in two words

Gnostic theist - believe in God, and knows that he exists for sure

Agnostic theist - believes in God, but through faith, not knowledge

Gnostic Atheist - Knows there is no God

Agnostic Atheist - Admits the possibility, but just doesn't believe any of the proposed Gods

Why does academia prefer the (to me) more ambiguous term?

Where do we get our authority from?

Here’s a question that will help set us up for @ojabeyx5’s questions. The problem is that in order to establish any consensus, we need common ground, or a set of universal standards, on which to build our logic. Otherwise we’ll never understand each other. 

If one person depends on the Bible, and another on the Koran, they won’t get anywhere. Or, to use a software example, a request must provide an “Accepts” header to inform the server of acceptable response formats. Likewise, the questioner should reveal to the responder what kind of response they will respect. 

This satisfies OJ’s concern that many Christian apologists respond to atheists with a Christian argument. It also responds to Scott’s concern that we avoid bad faith or false teaching. 

Therefore, if one is making an argument based on a rational philosophical framework, the responder should respond using a rational philosophical framework. And if one is starting from a spiritual perspective, then the responder should respond using the spiritual perspective of the questioner. 

Therefore it is necessary for the questioner to reveal if they are questioning on the basis of pure reason, scientific evidence, biblical theology, etc. 

Hence the question in bold above. I think it will help us understand what we all agree on, and how we can build logic on top of that. 

@ojabeyx5 I think it will be helpful to respond with specific books, authors, theological frameworks, or logical frameworks that you use to validate or inform your beliefs. For example, if you find a specific type of philosophy, such as natural materialism theory, or theology, such as the Bible.

//

Observation & The Scientific Method
observation is an almost universally recognized source of logic parameters throughout cultures and over thousands of years. Observation is also the bedrock of modern science. However, observation is not adequate by itself IMO to seek truth. Human facilities have limited reliability leading different people to have different interpretation of certain events. Also, it doesn’t help us when discussing things that cannot be observed in the present, such as the origin of life, or the existence of spiritual realms.

//

Inductive Reasoning
What I mean by inductive reasoning is the attempt to identify the most logical explanation for a question, as opposed to deductive reasoning, which attempts to determine the binary true or false nature of a question. Since we are limited in our observation abilities, it is impossible to reason with 100% certainty any claim, except for possibly certain mathematical proofs. I believe it is more useful to compare different proposals and determine the one that is the most likely to be true, than to accept or recent a single claim. Therefore, when it comes to determining authority, I will always defer to the authority that seems most likely to be reliable, rather than to assert that a particular authority is absolutely true or absolutely false. However, once I determine an authority to be the most reliable option, I may use it to build deductive proofs that explore the implications of that authority being reliable. 

//

The Bible
The books of the Bible are a collection of observations of human events that point to the existence of God. It is the largest collection of human experience across languages, cultures, and history, spanning at least ~2,400 years, with possibly corroborating archeological evidence going back another 1,000 years or so.  This makes the Bible the single most important historical document for understanding the human experience, and how it has evolved. It is also the single most reliable historical document from ancient civilization, with the most agreeing streams of transmission. None of the events in the Bible can be decisively disproven, and many of them can be corroborated, more and more as archeological finds increase. While science and history are limited in their ability to explain the origin of life, I believe the Bible offers the most complete explanation of the origin of life, and the most compatible with modern day observations. While many disagree with the Bible’s claims, they have not been able to publish a more complete explanation which can achieve a higher level of veracity in the historical record, and would be accepted by so many people throughout history. 

//

Summary

If you understand the above, you will likely understand any argument I make, with minimal clarification. 

If I violate any of the above, I will quickly recognize my error if you point it out. 

If you disagree with at least one of these things, then it will be easy to seek truth based on that as a premise. However, if you reject all of them, it will be impossible to see eye to eye without establishing a separate common ground of some sort. 

//

This is effectively an invitation for you to criticize any of my views based on these frameworks. If you can point out inconsistencies in my beliefs on my own terms, I’m likely to change my mind. This should give you all the tools you need to change my mind. Otherwise without this invitation it would be really hard. 

So @ojabeyx5 and @Scott hopefully you aren’t as wordy as me, but a quick summary of what would change your mind and why would be helpful so we can establish common ground. 

For me, if you can show me that one of my views:

    conflict with biblical teaching

relies on logical fallacies (as opposed to inductive reasoning, which is not a fallacy despite lacking 100% proof)contradicts the preponderance of human observation on the subject

Then I am likely to change my mind
What would change yours?
