Heb 4:12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

Mat 13:52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.

Ecc 1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.

Gal 3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.

//

Rom 3:3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
Rom 3:4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

//

Act 15:10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
Act 15:11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.

//

Rev 2:2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

Rev 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

Rev 2:13 I know thy works and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

Rev 2:19 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.

Rev 3:1 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.

Rev 3:8 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

Rev 3:15 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.

Mat 7:21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
Mat 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
Mat 7:23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

Luk 9:51 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
Luk 9:52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
Luk 9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
Luk 9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?
Luk 9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
Luk 9:56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.

Joh 4:5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
Joh 4:6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
Joh 4:7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
Joh 4:8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
Joh 4:9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
Joh 4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
Joh 4:11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
Joh 4:12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
Joh 4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
Joh 4:14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
Joh 4:15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
Joh 4:16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
Joh 4:17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
Joh 4:18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
Joh 4:19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
Joh 4:20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
Joh 4:21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
Joh 4:22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
Joh 4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
Joh 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

Act 10:34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
Act 10:35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.

Act 17:30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:

//

Rom 2:6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
Rom 2:7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
Rom 2:8 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
Rom 2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
Rom 2:10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
Rom 2:11 For there is no respect of persons with God.

Rom 2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
Rom 2:15 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)

1Co 1:12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
1Co 1:13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?

//

Joh 10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
Joh 10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
Joh 10:34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
Joh 10:35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
Joh 10:36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
Joh 10:37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
Joh 10:38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

//

Joh 8:46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
Joh 8:47 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.
Joh 8:48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
Joh 8:49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

//

Joh 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
Joh 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

//

2Pe 3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
2Pe 3:16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

//

Mat 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
Mat 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
Mat 25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Mat 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
Mat 25:35 For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
Mat 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Mat 25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
Mat 25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
Mat 25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
Mat 25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

* // We think to ourselves, the mormons are mistaken about their beliefs, as if this is some new thing
* // ..
* // "When the Lord Jesus described His second coming, and the danger at that time to people who are not pleasing Him, He never once mentioned our belief in doctrine. His warning always had to do with how we have managed our talents, how we treated our fellow servants, whether or not we gave a cup of water to His brothers. Never did the Lord make belief in doctrine an issue.

  The Lord Jesus did state we must believe in Him. But His point was that because of our belief in Him we would do what He taught. It never was and never will be the teaching of the Lord Jesus that our belief in Him is to be an abstract “faith,” an alternative to faithful obedience to His commands; that such an abstract theological profession is to serve as a magic formula that guarantees our entrance to eternal Paradise. Yet this is the concept conveyed by those who stress the “four steps of salvation” apart from a disciplined following of the Lord.

  “Accepting Christ” in this abstract theological sense has taken the place of receiving the resurrected Rabbi of Nazareth and following Him in stern obedience every day of our life. It is this substitution of a doctrinal stance for an actual cleaving in love to the risen Lord that has made current Christianity the enemy of Christ. We are not accepting Jesus, we are accepting doctrine. There is a difference between these two definitions of “faith.”"

* // ..
* // We Christians place far too much emphasis on religion and not nearly enough on what kind of person we are. But God virtually ignores the religion in favor of what kind of person we are (as measured by our behavior). It is the purpose of religion to make us better people, not more fervent, more accurate religionists. Christ welcomes people, not religion. He is a Savior and King, not a theologian or the leader of a religion.
* // ..
* // Mormons Are a Lot Like Samaritans
  Jesus was Jewish, while the Samaritans were members of a rival faith. They had their own rival priesthood and temple, and their own version of the scriptures. There was also a history of antagonism with the Jews. So Mormons relate to Christians much like Samaritans did to Jews. As we look at how Jesus interacted with a Samaritan woman in John 4, we learn how he might relate to Mormons.

* For those in the "Paul Within Judaism" camp like Frederiksen, Paul is addressing a non-Jewish audience. (See "Paul Within Judaism" edited by Mark Nanos and Magnus Zetterholm, where Frederiksen contributes but does not address the Galatians passage specifically.) Nanos, in his "Irony of Galatians," points out that Paul is speaking ironically to his non-Jewish community, which seems to have shifted its stance towards strictly Jewish behaviors and customs due to Jewish interlopers coming to them with a different message that called for strict adherence to Jewish customs. If this is the case, then it makes sense for Frederiksen to come closer to an "all or nothing" stance for non-Jews because they are not a part of the covenant at Sinai, which includes circumcision, an issue Paul addresses in this letter. For Jews, however, from my reading of her works, it does not appear to be the case that she would hold that view, seeing the level of religious observance among Jews even today varies greatly. (Karin Hedner Zetterholm addresses this issue in the book above.) The issue then becomes one of who is "in" and who is "out" sociologically. The schema Paul lays out forces non-Jews to believe in order to show certain behaviors in order to belong while Jews belong first, then act like Jews with their beliefs being the lowest priority.

Another issue at play: the word and its variations Paul uses for "law" in Greek, "nomos," "nomoi," etc. is used in different contexts to refer to different things. Is Paul talking about civil law, the Torah, the "law of sin and death," etc.? Depending on the kind of law, the audience could shift dramatically and vice versa.

Lastly, the articles posted seem to either come from a "New Perspective" viewpoint on Paul or one that is "older" in nature. If, as the one article concludes as I understand it, Paul is speaking more universally without making a distinction between Jews and non-Jews, this seems to break down the special calling and distinction of Jews, which would completely go against Paul's argument for these non-Jews to not act more Jewish as this breaches identity boundaries. Thus, the verse in Galatians 3:10 loc. cit. is meant to discourage Paul's non-Jewish community from taking on certain identity markers, not to disparage Jews, Jewish customs, or the Torah. If Paul is speaking ironically as Nanos proposes, then we can understand the verse as saying, "You non-Jews, you are free in Christ Jesus because of your faithfulness, but taking on Jewish identity markers is going too far, and it is as if you are under a curse because that destroys the covenantal distinction between Jews and non-Jews."

* Perhaps because a majority of his target audience were Gentiles, who were excluded from being able to perform some of the works of the Law, and were also probably not capable of performing a lot of them due to cultural differences and logistical issues.

In Romans 3-4 for example (even throughout the entire letter or Romans), Paul always brings up the issue of the perceived division between Gentiles and Jews in terms of what makes them righteous and eligible for salvation. In Galatians, there was this argument whether or not circumcision was necessary for Gentiles to become part of their church. I think in Paul's time, there were many arguments with regards to establishing a "minimum compliance" with the Law before a Gentile becomes a member of their church.

I think Paul argues that a Gentile is not "less righteous" than a Jewish disciple because a Gentile follower would have essentially done less works of the Law. Instead, he argues that both Gentile and Jew are justified by the same standard, which is faith in the gospel he preaches, instead of works of the Law.

A Gentile's righteousness not being based on obeying the entire Torah was a common view during that time. This is where Paul deviates - he also preached that the same rule applied to a Jew's righteousness.

* Paul was talking about whether Gentiles had to convert to Judaism - get circumcised, stop eating pork and follow Jewish law in order to be among the "saved" when Jesus came back. This was a significant controversy in Paul's day because the original movement did not see itself as a new religion, but still as a Jewish sect. This made it much more difficult to convert Gentiles because it's hard to talk guys into giving up bacon and cutting part of their junk off. Paul instead promoted what he called a "circumcision of the heart" (Romans 2:29 which itself is an allusion to Deuteronomy 30:6) to sort of bypass the physical requirements with an argument that physical circumcision became "uncircumcision" for those who transgressed the law, so that circumcision was really any inner event, not a physical event.

* This is all the result of a misreading of Paul. Faith and works as an opposed binary in the works of Paul have a specific context. "Works" is short for works of the Law which is itself short for the conviction that only Jews should be admitted into the church. "Faith" (usually better translated "faithfulness") stands for the faithfulness of Jesus (most notably on the cross) which Paul understands to be available to all who "put on Christ".

Faith and works in Paul deal specifically with the question of whether gentiles can be Christians. Paul is on the side of faith i.e. gentile inclusion. His opponents who were apparently quite successful early on were on the side of works (Paul's terminology) i.e. gentile exclusion (or must be circumcised first).

Some readers misunderstood Paul. It's an understandible mistake. He was using shorthand - coded language. This misunderstanding is likely pretty early, because James appears to be correcting it and 2 Peter alludes to it.

For a good scholarly dive into the topic, I highly recommend The Deliverance of God, by Douglas A. Campbell.

* !!!!! A good supplement to this perspective is Paul and the Gift by John Barclay. He argues that grace as “free gift” in the context of first century Greek/ANE culture would have been understood differently than we understand it today. In short, a free gift is not without strings attached. Free gifts can come with obligations.

* I have not read enough of N.T. Wright to know if this is one of his ideas (it seems to me that it might be), but it is something that I have thought about for some years. Whenever I read or hear something from Wright, I am usually impressed that he has a lot of the same left-field ideas as I have developed. Many here have read much of Wright, and understand him well (I don't know that I do), and can let me know if he actually is saying something different...

In my understanding, faith and faithfulness are not really meant to be two things, but are a reference to buying into, and remaining in, a covenantal relationship with God, including all that it implies for both sides. It is, possibly, no different from when a marrying couple used to both say, as a part of their vows: "I pledge thee my troth." The word "troth" clearly bears a genetic relation to "truth"—which has the meaning (even in many Old Testament passages in the Olde English versions) of fidelity—specifically to a covenant.

One of the great Hebrew words in the Old Testament is chesed, which many English translations render as "mercy" or "lovingkindness," but which lexicographers usually interpret to mean something like "fidelity to covenant duties." A word study of chesed, in the Old Testament will show it to be one of, if not the, most frequent terms to describe God's character and behavior toward His people. It is also very frequently said to be the thing that God desires in man. This is so frequently so that, it would be fair to consider pistis ( "faith/faithfulness") to be a functional synonym (though not a translation) of chesed.

Our entire connection to, and claim upon, God is through the covenant. God is faithful to His covenant, and therefore inspires faith in us toward Him. By the same token, we are to be faithful to the covenant, allowing God to have confidence in us as well. Evangelicals usually shrink from suggesting that God can have confidence (faith) in us (who, allegedly, "sin many times in thought, word and deed every day"!), but there is nothing more strange about this suggestion than to think husbands and wives can expect equal covenant faithfulness from each other, and can therefore trust each other. God knows my frame, so He knows how far He can trust me, and how little to expect from me. He also knows, however, that my commitment is total. If it were not so, I do not believe that I would qualify to lay claim to a covenantal relationship with Him.

Paul said that God put him in his particular ministry role because God "counted [Paul] faithful" (1 Tim.1:12). God could trust Paul, just like Sarah trusted God because she "counted Him faithful" (Heb.11:11). In a normal (not an exceptional) covenant relationship between two parties, mutual trust is a reasonable component.

Thus, when the Bible says that someone has impressed God, or Jesus, by their display of pistis, or that we possess a saving relationship with God through pistis, we do not need to choose between the English options "faith" and "faithfulness." In terms of covenant relationships, both exist simultaneously, on the part of both parties. It seems that the Reformation lost sight of this fact, in distancing itself from Catholic legalism and ritualistic righteousness. The word "faith" was taken only to mean "belief," which is truly one of its meanings, in certain contexts. Unfortunately, this set the Gospel, as understood by the reformers, in radical contrast to what God has always required from people—namely, chesed. It changed the terms of salvation into a novel policy of God bartering eternal life for mere belief—instead of an all-in covenantal relationship. The state of the evangelical churches, who think themselves proud to hold to this reformation distinctive, bear unmistakeable and tragic testimony to the fact that the gospel, as preached today, is very different from that preached by the apostles.

* !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Matthew Bates’ book Salvation by Allegiance Alone makes the provocative case that the concept of faith would be better understood as “fidelity,” “loyalty,” “faithfulness,” or “allegiance.” In that respect, he proposes, there is an interior, mental aspect to loyalty (i.e. we need to be loyal in our mental lives) but also an exterior aspect to loyalty (i.e. what we do). So the latter isn’t “works” in the sense of earning something—he calls it “embodied loyalty.” Look at it this way: if we had coffee, and I said, “Did you hear about the Smiths? They’re getting a divorce.” You might well ask, “Oh, no; what happened?” If I then say, “It turns out that John was unfaithful,” you wouldn’t think that John had stopped believing that Jane was his wife. You’d (rightly!) assume that he’d done something. After all, as Bates points out, the opposite of faith isn’t works—it’s unfaithfulness.

  * !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's an interesting argument considering the church is frequently called the bride of Christ and Israel is described as married to God

    * !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Right? It’s interesting to see the many ways that Israel is likened to a rebellious spouse or child. Bates helped me realize that Israel’s failure wasn’t that they were disobedience as such. It was that they were disloyal to their God. They were, in effect, traitors seeking to throw off the rightful authority of the king (a thing humans have been doing since the garden).

  * I came to the comments to recommend this book as well. Reading Paul's statements involving "faith" and "faithful" thought the lens of loyalty much more logical and cohesive for me. It better ties the themes of the Old Testament's kings and their loyalty (and lack thereof) to God to the new covenant where Jesus is the ultimate King. I thought Bates presented is argument well, though I've not been able to find tremendous support for them. However, I believe that's due to the majority of authors and interpretations presuming faith always = belief.

    * however, paul seems insistent that we (or, at least, new converts) should avoid some works; and that we are free from the law that requires works. does bates fit these positions in his view?

      * How do you define “works?” That seems to be the central problem. If “works” are salvation-earning things, then that’s not at all what Paul is talking about. The thing that drives me crazy about pop Christianity is the idea that Judaism was a “works-based” religion, in the sense of earning salvation through (perfect) obedience. Sanders decisively shut the door on that view in academic theology, but it persists at the popular level (aided in no small measure by the over-zealous adherents to “Reformed” theology).

        * Curiously catholicism has a similar branding as works based religion, mostly because a lot of people don't reconcile that they too believe in initial justification by faith, and growth of righteousness/responding to the grace attained salvation by works.

        Specifically in protestant circles and even catholics mistake this faith and works meaning but at this point I've digressed enough.

* In this episode of Ehrman's podcast, he says that, when Paul wrote that one was made righteous (justified) by faith and not by works, he meant that one was made righteous by the relationship based on trust in Christ's sacrifice and not by the works of the Jewish law. He did not mean that one was made righteous by assent to an idea regardless of one's actions (as Ehrman points out, it wouldn't make sense for Paul to spend a third of a letter talking about how one ought to behave if he thought it was irrelevant).

* Through works, if we're gonna judge by Romans 2:6-7, 1 Corinthians 3:13, 2 Corinthians 5:10, etc. When he contrasts "faith" vs works (of the law), what he means by works there is the ceremonial commandments followed by Jews that were markers of their separation from other nations, at least that was a big point made by various scholars of the so called New Perspective on Paul camp, you can eg read James Dunn's book New Perspective on Paul for an overview.

The second part of that contrast of "faith" vs works, is also discussed, what does Paul mean by "faith", is that the correct way to translate it, is it something that is not a work you do, but maybe a belief (or a set of them) you hold, like traditionally many Christians believed and still do? Various scholars have proposed different ways of understanding it.

For example people like Paula Fredriksen (Paul, the Pagans' Apostle) and Mathew Bates (Salvation by Allegiance Alone) proposed it should be understood as fidelity, faithfulness to someone or something, allegiance.

Scholar NT Wright (eg in the book Paul and the Faithfulness of God) said Paul is talking about faithfulness of God there, that is what people are saved by. That is a pretty popular view, you can catch it being talked about in these discussions as the "subjective genitive" view on the phrase pistis Christou, which is opposed to the traditional way of understanding it as an 'objective genitive', as faith in Christ (or maybe faithfulness to Christ).

My personal favorite is a kinda niche perspective called the 'adjectival genitive' view, given by scholars such as Sam Williams (Again Pistis Christou) and Arland Hultgren (The Pistis Christou Formulation in Paul), which say we should understand it as "faithfulness of Christ" but in an adjectival way, like eg when someone says we should have the courage of lion, ie we should have courage like a lion has, and that Paul is saying we should have faithfulness like Christ had it. Which would be parallel to another place where Paul uses pistis plus genitive, when he says in Romans 4:16 that the promise comes to those who have the pistis of Abraham; surely he doesn't mean to those who have "faith in Abraham" or those to whom Abraham is faithful, so parallel to that we can understand pistis Christou that people are saved by as being the Christ-like faithfulness those people have. And what is this faithfulness, well, Paul seems to describe it in Romans 2:7 that I mentioned in the beginning, as "persistence in doing good".

* On one hand consider the NPP (new perspectives on Paul) positions, for example you can find a summary of NT Wright's thinking on his Youtube or his books on Justification, but there are going to be many branches of NPP. One major line of thinking from "Paul and the Faithfulness of God" (Wright) is that our definition of Justification may need to factor in eastern context; also it's important to consider whether Paul's passage is about all 'works in general' or 'works of the law' (referring to the Torah?). He cites numerous academic sources to build these arguments.

Desiring God has 2 articles (less strictly academic!) from Piper on "Are we saved by faith alone" that are useful, he points out that Paul uses the word Salvation with past, ongoing, and future tenses (we have been saved, we are being saved, we will be saved) suggesting that Salvation is a process, and he agrees with Luther re: Justification is by Faith alone; however he posits that sanctification and glorification would not be by faith alone so it may not be accurate to say that 'Salvation is by Faith alone'.

Need to spend a bit of time considering 'what exactly are you Saved / Rescued from/towards'.

* Genuinely interested in why the academic definition is this way. I'm not academic and the first common definitions the OP laid out seem much more useful and linguistically consistent than the academic version of 'Anyone who believes there is no God'. That definition only describes a small subset of non believers.

To highlight what I mean I'll reiterate the common usage which uses the usual meaning of the prefix 'a' meaning 'without'. (As in moral/amoral)

Theism = Belief in God A-theism = Without belief in God

Gnosticism = Knowledge of God A-gnotsic = Without knowledge of God

Thus pretty much all positions can be accurately described in two words

Gnostic theist - believe in God, and knows that he exists for sure

Agnostic theist - believes in God, but through faith, not knowledge

Gnostic Atheist - Knows there is no God

Agnostic Atheist - Admits the possibility, but just doesn't believe any of the proposed Gods

Why does academia prefer the (to me) more ambiguous term?

Where do we get our authority from?

Here’s a question that will help set us up for @ojabeyx5’s questions. The problem is that in order to establish any consensus, we need common ground, or a set of universal standards, on which to build our logic. Otherwise we’ll never understand each other. 

If one person depends on the Bible, and another on the Koran, they won’t get anywhere. Or, to use a software example, a request must provide an “Accepts” header to inform the server of acceptable response formats. Likewise, the questioner should reveal to the responder what kind of response they will respect. 

This satisfies OJ’s concern that many Christian apologists respond to atheists with a Christian argument. It also responds to Scott’s concern that we avoid bad faith or false teaching. 

Therefore, if one is making an argument based on a rational philosophical framework, the responder should respond using a rational philosophical framework. And if one is starting from a spiritual perspective, then the responder should respond using the spiritual perspective of the questioner. 

Therefore it is necessary for the questioner to reveal if they are questioning on the basis of pure reason, scientific evidence, biblical theology, etc. 

Hence the question in bold above. I think it will help us understand what we all agree on, and how we can build logic on top of that. 

@ojabeyx5 I think it will be helpful to respond with specific books, authors, theological frameworks, or logical frameworks that you use to validate or inform your beliefs. For example, if you find a specific type of philosophy, such as natural materialism theory, or theology, such as the Bible.

//

Observation & The Scientific Method
observation is an almost universally recognized source of logic parameters throughout cultures and over thousands of years. Observation is also the bedrock of modern science. However, observation is not adequate by itself IMO to seek truth. Human facilities have limited reliability leading different people to have different interpretation of certain events. Also, it doesn’t help us when discussing things that cannot be observed in the present, such as the origin of life, or the existence of spiritual realms.

//

Inductive Reasoning
What I mean by inductive reasoning is the attempt to identify the most logical explanation for a question, as opposed to deductive reasoning, which attempts to determine the binary true or false nature of a question. Since we are limited in our observation abilities, it is impossible to reason with 100% certainty any claim, except for possibly certain mathematical proofs. I believe it is more useful to compare different proposals and determine the one that is the most likely to be true, than to accept or recent a single claim. Therefore, when it comes to determining authority, I will always defer to the authority that seems most likely to be reliable, rather than to assert that a particular authority is absolutely true or absolutely false. However, once I determine an authority to be the most reliable option, I may use it to build deductive proofs that explore the implications of that authority being reliable. 

//

The Bible
The books of the Bible are a collection of observations of human events that point to the existence of God. It is the largest collection of human experience across languages, cultures, and history, spanning at least ~2,400 years, with possibly corroborating archeological evidence going back another 1,000 years or so.  This makes the Bible the single most important historical document for understanding the human experience, and how it has evolved. It is also the single most reliable historical document from ancient civilization, with the most agreeing streams of transmission. None of the events in the Bible can be decisively disproven, and many of them can be corroborated, more and more as archeological finds increase. While science and history are limited in their ability to explain the origin of life, I believe the Bible offers the most complete explanation of the origin of life, and the most compatible with modern day observations. While many disagree with the Bible’s claims, they have not been able to publish a more complete explanation which can achieve a higher level of veracity in the historical record, and would be accepted by so many people throughout history. 

//

Summary

If you understand the above, you will likely understand any argument I make, with minimal clarification. 

If I violate any of the above, I will quickly recognize my error if you point it out. 

If you disagree with at least one of these things, then it will be easy to seek truth based on that as a premise. However, if you reject all of them, it will be impossible to see eye to eye without establishing a separate common ground of some sort. 

//

This is effectively an invitation for you to criticize any of my views based on these frameworks. If you can point out inconsistencies in my beliefs on my own terms, I’m likely to change my mind. This should give you all the tools you need to change my mind. Otherwise without this invitation it would be really hard. 

So @ojabeyx5 and @Scott hopefully you aren’t as wordy as me, but a quick summary of what would change your mind and why would be helpful so we can establish common ground. 

For me, if you can show me that one of my views:

    conflict with biblical teaching

relies on logical fallacies (as opposed to inductive reasoning, which is not a fallacy despite lacking 100% proof)contradicts the preponderance of human observation on the subject

Then I am likely to change my mind
What would change yours?
